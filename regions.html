<h1>What is DVD Region Protection?</h1>

<p>
Perhaps you've recently bought, or thought of buying, a DVD reproducer. You probably don't know that the DVD reproducers sold in common retail stores have a little <q>feature</q> called <em>Region Protection</em>. What is it?
</p>

<p>
The movie industry has divided the world in six regions:  Region 1 includes the US and Canada, Region 2 includes Europe and Japan, and so on. It has pressured electronics and software firms to lock reproducers into one of these regions, so that a disc purchased in the US will not play in a reproducer purchased in Europe. Discs only play in reproducers of the same region.
Typically, specialized magazines and industry spokespeople cite one of several factors to explain Region Protection:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Since movies open at different times throughout the world, people could conceivably buy the DVD in the US before it opens in their own country, thus damaging movie theater business.</li>
<li>Some people could buy the DVD and set up an illegal <q>movie theater</q> to compete with traditional ones.</li>
<li>People could mistakenly buy discs that don't include audio or subtitles in their native language.</li>
</ul>

<p>
In my opinion, while all these are certainly important reasons, they don't warrant making artificial barriers. If I want to buy my discs in the US and play them in Spain, that's certainly nobody's business. And if you want to buy a DVD on a trip, or buy a cheap reproducer in Taiwan, you should be able to do so.

<h2>How to avoid Region Protection</h2>

<ul>
<li>Buy a <q>modified</q> player capable of playing different regions. I buy mine from <a href="http://www.mundolaser.com/">Mundolaser</a>.</li>
<li>If you're lucky you'll be able to watch discs from several regions in:
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.dvd.reviewer.co.uk/info/multiregion/">Your stand-alone 	reproducer</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.wormintheapple.gr/macdvd/">Your Mac</a></li>
	<li>Your Windows PC: you'll need <a 	href="http://www.inmatrix.com/genie/">software</a>, and perhaps <a 	href="http://forum.firmware-flash.com/portal.php">firmware</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Complain about region protection to salespeople, manufacturers and others. One day they're bound to listen.</li>
</ul>
